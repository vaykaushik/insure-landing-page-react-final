** Please note - I got stuck with the mobile navigation background part according to the original design. This I was unable to figure out! **

**WHAT WAS THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT?**

1) To understand the SMACSS convention in a little more detail as well as how you can use conditionals within mixins.
2) To understand the basics of useState to dynamically update state within a component.
3) To improve my overall CSS/SCSS skills.

**THINGS I WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY:**

1) Plan more! I rushed into this project a little too quickly and as a result, suffered later on.
2) Have a leaner/simpler approach! I had scalability as being the number one factor in mind and as a result, I made it more complicated than it should have been.

**THINGS I LEARNED IN THIS PROJECT:**

1) Understanding the basics of the SMACSS convention and what the merits of it could be for dealing with a larger project.
2) Understanding the basics of useState in relation to the mobile navigation menu and how you can use this when combined with synthetic events such as 'onClick'.
3) Using module.scss, so you can write your code directly inside of 'className', rather than in a seperate function outside of the element.
